    "\n",
    "Welcome. This is a set of notebooks designed to teach you how to use (and hopefully understand) a software package called Geomstats. Geomstats is an open source code that uses concepts from Riemannian Geometry to analyze data that lie on manifolds (what it means for \"data to lie on a manifold\" will be explained in further detail in the next section). Geomstats is one of the first software packages of its kind. Before Geomstats and software packages like it, only people with prior knowledge of Riemannian geometry could analyze data on manifolds. The Geomstats package aims to make this type of data analysis more accessible to people who do not have prioro knowledge of Riemannian geometry. These instructional notebooks word towards Geomstats' goal to foster accessibility."

    "The number of $\\textbf{Degrees of Freedom}$ a system has is equivalent to the number of variables needed to describe the system completely. For example, an object moving freely in three dimensions will require three variables to describe it completely $(x,y,z), (\\phi,\\theta, r)$. If you can describe an object's motion in three dimensions, you would not want to use four variables to describe its motion because keeping track of another variable is mentally taxing (if you are solving a problem on paper) and more computationally expensive (if you are solving the problem with a computer). Similarly, if you now know that this free particle is moving on the surface of a sphere, you would want to analyze the particle using two varibles $(\\theta,\\phi)$ instead of three ($\\phi,\\theta,$ r)."

    "Objects travelling along a manifold often follow geodescics on that manifold. A geodescic is the shortest distance that a particle can travel in the space that it is in.
