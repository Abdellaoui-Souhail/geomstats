    "From social networks to parse trees, knowledge graphs to protien interaction networks, Graph-Structured Data is endemic to a wide variety of natural and engineered systems. Often, understanding the structure and/or dynamics of these graphs yeilds insight into the systems under investigation. Take, for example, the problems of finding key influencers or distinct communities within social networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of graph embedding is to find a way of representing the graph in a space which more readily lends itself to analysis/investigation. One approach is to identify points in a vector space with nodes of the graph in such a way that important relations between nodes are preserved via relations between their corresponding points.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide variety of methods which approach this problem in different ways and for different aims, say for clustering or for link prediction. Recently, the embedding of Graph Structured Data (GSD) on manifolds has received considerable attention. In particular, much work has shown that hyperbolic spaces are beneficial for a wide variety of tasks with GSD. This tutorial shows how to learn such embeddings using the Poincaré Ball manifold and the well-known 'Karate Club' social network dataset with `geomstats`. This data and several others can be found in the `datasets.data` module of the project's github repository. "
